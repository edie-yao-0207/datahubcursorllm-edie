package mock_databricks

// This is a scenarios file for mock_databricks. You are encouraged to add canonical mocks for this
// interface that can be shared between tests.
// If this mock is for an API owned by a specific team, you should consider adding a CODEREVIEW
// file on this file if you want to gate canonical "good" mocked responses & scenarios.
// Functions should be held *on* the mock interface

// SomeFunctionFixture sets a standard response for SomeFunction.
// You should change the name of this function / add more to the file to be
// domain specific to your mock
func (mock *MockAPI) SomeFunctionFixture() *MockAPI {
	// Set the response for mock.SomeFunction

	return mock
}
