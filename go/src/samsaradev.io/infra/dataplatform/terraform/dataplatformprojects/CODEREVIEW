Please be cognizant of the fact that deleting an entry from this registry code can permanently remove table/view definitions. If applicable, please run `go test -run=TestDBNames -rewriteSnapshots` in `go/src/samsaradev.io/infra/dataplatform/terraform/dataplatformprojects` folder to acknowledge the change to the DB registry. \n Note that running the test does not back up any tables. Please reach out to #ask-data-platform for any questions or concerns."
